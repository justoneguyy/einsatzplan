Menu in Dialog:

- Command:
    + is working with multiple selections
    + can be a drawer in mobile view
    - scroll function doesnt work in dialog, dont know why

- Select:
    + Scrolling is working with "unique" scroll icon
    - cant be a drawer in mobile view
    - doesnt support multiple selections

- Dropdown:
    + multiple selections possible
    - cant be a drawer in mobile view
    - no scroll at all


final conclusion:
    -> im gonna use a select which adds an item on select above the select itself, so multiple can be selected if needed.
        - need zod for validation, so that no items can be selected twice.
        - there should be no CheckIcon.
        - the item should be deletable
        - should the item be editable?
