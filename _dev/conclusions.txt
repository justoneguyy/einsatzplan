Menu in Dialog:

- Command:
    + is working with multiple selections
    + can be a drawer in mobile view
    - scroll function doesnt work in dialog, dont know why

- Select:
    + Scrolling is working with "unique" scroll icon
    - cant be a drawer in mobile view
    - doesnt support multiple selections

- Dropdown:
    + multiple selections possible
    - cant be a drawer in mobile view
    - no scroll at all


final conclusion:
    -> im gonna use a select which adds an item on select above the select itself, so multiple can be selected if needed.
        - need zod for validation, so that no items can be selected twice.
        - there should be no CheckIcon.
        - the item should be deletable
        - should the item be editable?


Table or Grid for dashboard:

    - deciding factor is if I want "filtering" (hiding).
        - rufbereitschaft (could also be set to the user role.)
            -> the background of the cell should be blue
            -> maybe indicator beneath the employee who currently has rufbereitschaft
        -

    - would need to somehow implement resizing in the table.






Authentication:

    Registration:
        - Firstname, Lastname, Password
            - the email and the username will be shown aswell in the registration and be automatically generetated by the input from firstname + lastname but only the "first part" of the email can be edited (@uhlhorn.de cant be edited and will always remain) in case of a mismatch between the actual email and the automatic generated one. this will only happen if, why so ever, the actual email is not in sync with the one that is being generated by the firstname + lastname. in this case, the username will be automatically updated by the changed email.
            - by default, the user is being registered with the user 'role' and no groups. this can be updated by the administrators.

    Login:
        - username / email + password

    Administration:
        - there will be an employee-administration page for the admins where all of the employees/users are listed.
        - updatable options: role, groups; delete employee
        - not editable by the admin (this can be done by the user itself): firstname, lastname, username, email, initials, profilePicture
        - can edit employees in case of the email or username not being 'in sync' with the default pattern. normally this shouldnt happen. the email can be edited directly

    Individual User Settings:
        - the user will have a settings site where he can update his own informations.
        - firstname, lastname, email, profilePicture
        - username, initials will be automatically updated with informations from the others but still shown in the form.

    Validation:
        - The firstname and lastname are being validated with zod and a regex as refinement.
        - The email will be automatically put together as described above but if it mismatches with the actual one it can be edited. zod and a regex will also be of help here.
        - password: dont know yet. probably some complex regex but maybe it shouldnt be too strict because of the other default settings from other services we use. security doesnt play a huge role here.
