## things to handle

- todos
- mobile version
- zod
- add more refinement checks to zod if bored
- unused imports, empty Classnames
- refactor imports to not use relative paths
- html best practices (handling tags and attributes e.g. dont use div all the time)
- look over the file/folder structure & potentially refactor
- add favicon
- umlaute & sz etc. reinpacken
- standardize all const and function components; also ui components -> no default export; also normal components -> default export
- change naming of files, folders and components to be more consistent
- change metadata in layouts for each site
- create error pages
- change scrollbar
- remove console.logs
- save states in localstorage or database? (e.g. when hiding a column from the table)
- better error handling
- berufsschuletage handling (die tage sollten bei den azubis ausw√§hlbar sein (und auch bis wann oder automatisch bis zu den naechsten sommerferien))
- feiertage fetchen per api
- save the state of the calendar (daily, weekly, monthly) in localstorage
- cleaner structure of files, folders and code

## einsatzplan

### weekview

- tasks should be cards with the following attributes:
  - title
  - start date (should be extandable with maybe a time picker or a time range picker)
  - end date (should be extandable with maybe a time picker or a time range picker)
  - user (from dropdown menu)
  - redmine ticket url
  - description
  - ? singlePerson or multiplePerson icon in the top right corner which indicates if the task is for one person or for multiple persons; it also shows which persons are involved on hover (or click). persons can also be quickly added or removed
  - ? type (e.g. "Urlaub", "Berufsschule", "Hotline")
  - ? color
- tasks should be draggable (with predefined ones); maybe with a "copy" button; i currently dont know where to put & how handle this
- saturday and sunday should be collapsable

- the cards are all horizontal placed and the user can scroll horizontally to see all cards/tasks.
- maybe make the above optional to a vertical solution
- the default shown task/card should be in sync with the current time.
- reusable tasks (e.g. "Urlaub", "Berufsschule", "Hotline")

## calendar

### behaviour

should the calendar be closed when a date is selected?

### button states

- daily: "20 Januar 2024"
- weekly: "KW 05 2024" OR "20 Jan 24 - 27 Jan 24" OR "20.01.24 - 27.01.24"
- monthly: "01.01.24 - 31.01.24"
